		<h2>About Us</h2>

		<p> 
			<span class="fun">Bubble Under</span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in south-west UK who meet for diving trips in the summer when the weather
is good and bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel, and to ensure that
everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our turf: past diving weekends have included trips up to Scapa Flow in
Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			When we're not diving we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?). 
		</p>
		
		<p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
		<blockquote class="fun">
			<p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen.  You can quote me on that!"
			</p>
