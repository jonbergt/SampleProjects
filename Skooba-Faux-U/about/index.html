		<h2>About Us</h2>

		<p> 
			<span class="fun">Skooba-Faux-U</span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the mid-Mississippi River Valley who meet for diving trips 
            in the summer when the weather is good and bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of 
            accommodation and travel, and to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			Although we're based in the mid-Mississippi area, we don't always stay only on our turf: past diving weekends have included trips 
         across the "pond" to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			When we're not diving we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?).

			<p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen.  You can quote me on that!"
